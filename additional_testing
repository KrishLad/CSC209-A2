Running two or more bg jobs and then turning one of them into fg

./myint 10 &
./myspin 15 &

fg <pid>

jobs

Running two or more fg jobs and then turning one of them into bg

./myint 10
./myspin 15

bg <pid>

jobs

Running bg and fg jobs and then switching both to opposite state

./myint 10 &
./myspin 15

bg <pid>
fg <pid>

jobs

Use fg/bg with both PID/JID

./myint 10 &

fg <jid> 

jobs

./myint 10

- STOP -

bg <jid> 

jobs

Error handling with do_bg
a) Turning a fg into a bg without stopping

./myint 10

bg <pid> 

b) Calling fg on fg program and bg on bg program

./myint 10 &  <- bg
./myspin 15  <- fg

bg <pid>  <- on first
fg <pid>  <- on second

c) Calling bg/fg on invalid pid/jid

./myint 10 &  <- bg
./myspin 15  <- fg

bg <pid>  <- on first invalid pid
fg <pid>  <- on second invalid jid
