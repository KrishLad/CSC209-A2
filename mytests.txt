# 1 - run multiple foreground jobs and call bg correctly
Expect it to run correctly and expect that it moves correct job to fg

./myint 10
TSTP

./myspin 20
TSTP

jobs
fg <pid of first call>
jobs

# 2 - use pipes to execute simple commands 
ls | grep .txt
ls | grep .c

# 3 - use multiple pipes in one command :  TODO

# 4 - use input and output redirection in both orders   :   TODO

# 5 - either one more pipe test or some edge case of dobgfg or signal handling - but please make it something that works, i dont want to code anymroe lol
